# Code Complexity Analyzer MVP – Requirement Definition Phase (RDP)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a **web-based Code Complexity Analyzer MVP** created as a hackathon prototype. It focuses on analyzing a single JavaScript source file to provide basic code complexity metrics within a very short development timeframe (approximately 2 hours).

The tool will parse the uploaded JavaScript file into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** – a tree representation of the code’s structure – which enables static analysis of the code. Using AST analysis, the system will compute the **cyclomatic complexity** of each function or method in the file and extract the module-level dependencies (import statements).

The **output** will be a raw JSON report containing the complexity for each function and a list of any modules the file imports. There will be no elaborate UI or visual charts – the emphasis is on functionality and **rapid prototyping** to demonstrate the concept within the hackathon’s time constraints.

## 2. Functional Requirements

* **Single File Upload Interface:** Simple web page with a file input (one JavaScript file).
* **AST Parsing of Code:** Parse code using Esprima/Acorn into an AST.
* **Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation:** Count decision points (`if`, `for`, `while`, `case`, etc.) per function.
* **Module-Level Dependency Extraction:** Collect module imports via `import` or `require()`.
* **JSON Output Generation:** Return results as raw JSON (functions + dependencies).

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** Must process a file in seconds.
* **Lightweight Implementation:** Use minimal libraries (Express, Esprima/Acorn).
* **Simplicity & Maintainability:** Keep architecture simple.
* **Reliability:** Handle valid JS files consistently.
* **Compatibility:** Support ES6+ syntax.
* **Security:** No code execution, static analysis only.
* **Usability:** Display JSON in browser (pretty-printed).

---

## 4. Technology Stack

* **Nextjs** for frontend and backend execution.
* **Shadcn** for UI.
* **Esprima/Acorn** for AST parsing.
* **Cyclomatic complexity logic:** via lightweight library (*escomplex*, *cyclomatic-js*) or simple AST walker.
* **Environment:** Local Nextjs  web app, Nextjs + Shadcn and anthropic llm for analyzing the code.

---

## 5. Output Specification

The tool returns raw **JSON** with:

* **Function Complexity List:** Array of function objects with `name` and `cyclomaticComplexity`.
* **Module Dependencies:** List of strings with module names.

**Example JSON Output:**

```json
{
  "functions": [
    { "name": "max", "cyclomaticComplexity": 2 },
    { "name": "square", "cyclomaticComplexity": 1 }
  ],
  "dependencies": ["fs"]
}
```

---

## 6. Constraints and Assumptions

* Only **one file at a time**.
* **JavaScript only (ES6+).**
* Assume **valid code** (limited error handling).
* **Static analysis only** – no execution.
* Minimal UI – just file upload and JSON output.
* Internet access assumed for npm packages.
* No persistence, no visualizations.

---

## 7. Milestones and Scope (2-Hour MVP)

1. **Setup (0–0.2h):** Init Node project, Express server, HTML upload page.
2. **File Upload (0.2–0.5h):** Handle single JS file upload.
3. **AST Parsing (0.5–1.0h):** Parse code with Esprima/Acorn.
4. **Complexity Calculation (1.0–1.5h):** Implement or call library for cyclomatic complexity per function.
5. **Dependency Extraction (1.0–1.5h):** Gather imports from AST.
6. **JSON Output (1.5–1.75h):** Assemble and return JSON.
7. **Testing & Demo Prep (1.75–2.0h):** Upload sample file, verify JSON output, finalize demo.

**Scope Control:**

* Focus only on cyclomatic complexity + dependencies.
* No UI beyond file input and JSON display.
* No extra metrics, no persistence, no multi-file analysis.

Do you also want me to **add a “Quickstart” section** at the end (with npm install + run commands) so your team can immediately test the MVP?
